    <p class="text-justify">Electronic voting systems based on blockchain technology have emerged as a potential solution to enhance the security and transparency of traditional voting methods. In this system, voters cast their votes electronically, and the results are stored on a decentralized blockchain ledger, which ensures the integrity of the vote by preventing any tampering or manipulation. This system provides a transparent and immutable record of votes, which can be accessed by anyone in the network, thus increasing trust in the electoral process. Nevertheless, the use of blockchain technology in electronic voting systems holds promise for creating a more secure, transparent, and democratic electoral process.</p>
    <p class="text-justify">The project consists of the implementation of a <strong>small-scale distributed electronic voting system</strong> based on <strong>blockchain technology</strong>.</p>
