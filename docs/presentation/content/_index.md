### Project's Goals

- **Small-scale** distributed electronic voting system
- _Blockchain technology_
- Uniform API to interact with the system by means of a web application

<!--
The project consists of the implementation of a **small-scale** distributed electronic voting system based on _blockchain technology_. Specifically, the goal is to create a distributed architecture that exposes a uniform API allowing users to interact with the system using a web application

### Non-functional properties (I)

**Thanks to _blockchain technology_ we achieve:**

- Operational integrity of the system:
  - Correctness of the operations performed by the system
- Accountability:
  - Node Peers logs the actions performed
- Confidentiality:
  - We used a **permissioned blockchain** that restrict access to data;
- Verifiability
  - Blockchain keep **tracks of all the transactions** executed to obtain final results;
- Availability
  - System will continue to serve requests even if some peers are down;

---

### Non-functional properties (II)

**We also designed the system to achieve:**

- Non-coercibility:
  - **Voters are not identifiable** during the voting process $\Rightarrow$ one time codes
- Voter Authentication:
  - Voters authentication provided by the API layer

---

### Technologies

- [Hyperledger Fabric](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric) as the blockchain infrastructure technology
  - modular and highly-configurable
    - _Java_ as a language for smart contracts
  - offers mechanisms raising the bar of confidentiality and higher fine-grained control over ledger access (e.g. channels and private data)
- _Docker_ for deployment
- ReSTful API
  - _Nodejs + Express_ for the API layer
